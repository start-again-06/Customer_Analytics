# Customer Analytics

---

## Introduction
This project provides essential customer analytics by calculating **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**, **retention rate**, and **churn rate** using a dataset of customer transactions. It helps businesses understand customer behavior and forecast revenue.

---

## Features
- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV):** Estimates total revenue from a customer  
- **Retention Rate:** Measures customer retention over time  
- **Churn Rate:** Determines the percentage of customers lost  

---

## Usage
1. Ensure **Python 3.x** and **Pandas** are installed.  
2. Prepare a CSV file named `customer_data.csv` (or specify a different file path).  
3. Run the script to view **CLV**, **retention rate**, and **churn rate** in the console.

## Best Practices
- Dataset should include columns: `CustomerID`, `AverageOrderValue`, `PurchaseFrequency`, and `CustomerLifespan`  
- Ensure data is cleaned and correctly formatted for accurate calculations  

---

## Limitations
- Requires structured and complete customer data  
- Assumes a static customer lifespan for CLV calculation
